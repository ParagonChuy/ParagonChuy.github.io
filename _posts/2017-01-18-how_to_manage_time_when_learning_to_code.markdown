#### Exponentially get better at coding with these tips.

Here is a list of concepts that allowed me to double my effectiveness as a developer:

1. Pomodoro
2. To-Do Lists
3. Throwing my phone across the room
4. Learning to Teach, not to Learn
5. Breathing.
6. Calendars.

## Breakdown as to why these worked for me


1. Working for longer hours leads to fatigue at a fast rate. By splitting up my work into 25 minutes of work time and 5 minutes of break time allowed me to come back to coding with a fresh mind. To maximize the effectiveness of this technique try to go outside and take a short walk.

2. For an extensive period I thought that I could simply remember everything I needed to. To-do lists alleviate the stress of having to remember to do tasks. Once in practice, you realize how much work you are actually getting done. A simple reminder that you are on the right or wrong path for your goals.

3. I throw my phone across the room when I begin to code. Granted it is in a case, I still do. I do this to remind myself that I am now in work mode and can not have any distractions. It can take up to 20 minutes to regain focus once it is lost. Imagine being on a streak, and now the streak is interrupted because one of your friends posted a picture on instagram.

4. Approach every new concept as if your task were to teach it to a class the next day. You'd obviously want to learn the topic fairly well in hopes of not embarrassing yourself in front of a theoretical class. In my case, I live streamed while I was learning to code, and actually did teach people as I went along.

5. When learning to code you will be bombarded with different barriers of entry. You have to learn a broad range of topics to be an effective developer. Taking the time to be mindful and breathe allows you to focus on the task at hand. This can be handy when you are trying to learn a new language and are being overwhelmed by new concepts. Step away from the computer, and breathe.

6. Calendars became my best friends as I learned more about time management. To use calendars effectively I encourage you to at the end of your days, spend 10 minutes scheduling your next day. You don't have to be precise, but this overview of your open up your eyes to the amount of time you spend on tasks that are either not benificial or a waste of time.
